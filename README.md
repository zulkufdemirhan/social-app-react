# How I workerd on this project

- My purpose in doing this study was to check what I learned. I thought of doing a small multi-component study and
  details helped me understand what I have learned and simulate the process of preparing a project
  a little. I observed what I did well and what I needed to improve.
      
      
- Before I started working, I took the app apart and went through it step-by-step. This helped me to work in a controlled and orderly manner. 
- I build this app  based on JavaScript/React.js 
- I created an Input panel. After entering the email and password on the panel, you can proceed to the next page. 
- I have reflected the user API that I pulled using Axios in the components and i used them by event features. 
- I used Responsive and other CSS features when necessary for the design. 
- I managed DOMs with events. 

# If I had more time I would add and change this 

 - CSS Hover and Transition Effects 
 - I could add a few components for other icons and they may have other features. 
 - I could create an input to change the information I pulled from the user APIs through the application.  
 - Finally, it would be sweet to receive notifications with toast messages.
