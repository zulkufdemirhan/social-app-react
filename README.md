# How I workerd on this project

     -Firstly my goal was to check what I learned I thought that doing a small study with many components and 
     details would help me understand what I learned and help me simulate the process of preparing a project 
     a little bit.I observed what I did well and needed to improve.
      
     -Before I started working, I took the app apart and went through it step-by-step. This helped 
     me to work in a controlled and orderly manner.
     -I build this app  based on JavaScript/React.js
     -I created an Input panel. After entering the email and password on the panel, you can proceed to the next page.
     -I have reflected the user API that I pulled using Axios in the components and i used them by event features.
     -I used Responsive and other CSS features when necessary for the design.
     -I managed DOMs with events.

# If I had more time I would add and change this 

     -CSS Hover and Transition Effects
     -I could add a few components for other icons and they may have other features.
     -I could create an input to change the information I pulled from the user APIs through the application. 
     -Finally, it would be sweet to receive notifications with toast messages.
