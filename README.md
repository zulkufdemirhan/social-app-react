# How I workerd on this project

My goal was to check what I learned and observe what I did well and needed to improve.
      
     -I build this app  based on JavaScript/React.js
     -Before I started working, I took the app apart and went through it step-by-step. This helped me to work in a controlled and orderly manner.

## How to navigate this project.

     -Responsive CSS using styled-where necessary.
     -I have reflected the user Api that I pulled using Axios in the components.
